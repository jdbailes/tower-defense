## Initial Setup
InteliJ would be the recomended IDE for this project, rather than Eclipse - but if you're familier with Eclipse then that's fine. Any instructions in this README will be targetted at an IntelliJ setup.

When you run Desktop Project for the first time the application will fail. To fix this, open the Run Configuration and set the working directory to the **core/assets** directory!

## Git Strategy
**Master** should represent our most recent release/submission, and any further development between submissions should be done on the **dev** branch. This strategy will allow us to maintain a view of our most recent release whilst allowing us to progress forward with further development on a more unstable dev branch. 

On the run up to a submission, we can orchestrate a group pull request/code review where we merge the dev branch into the master branch - this will give everyone an oppurtunity to see the code before a submission.
