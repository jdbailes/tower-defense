## Initial Setup
InteliJ would be the recomended IDE for this project, rather than Eclipse - but if you're familier with Eclipse then that's fine. Any instructions in this README will be targetted at an IntelliJ setup.

When you run Desktop Project for the first time the application will fail. To fix this, open the Run Configuration and set the working directory to the **core/assets** directory!
